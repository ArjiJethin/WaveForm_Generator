  <strong>Sine Wave Generator:</strong> The sine wave generator produces a
  smooth, continuous waveform characterized by its periodic nature. It is
  created using an operational amplifier in a Wien bridge or feedback
  configuration. The output signal is essential for applications requiring a
  pure frequency source, such as in audio systems and signal processing. The
  sine wave generator‚Äôs frequency and amplitude can be easily adjusted by
  varying the resistor and capacitor values in the circuit, making it versatile
  for various testing scenarios.

  <strong>Square Wave Generator:</strong> The square wave generator creates a
  waveform that alternates between two distinct voltage levels, producing a
  rapid rise and fall time. This waveform is achieved through astable
  multivibrator configurations using operational amplifiers. Square wave
  generators are widely used in digital circuits, clock signals, and pulse width
  modulation applications. The frequency, duty cycle, and amplitude can be
  modified by changing the component values, allowing for flexibility in design.

  <strong>Triangle Wave Generator:</strong> The triangle wave generator produces
  a linear ramping waveform that alternates between rising and falling slopes.
  This waveform is typically generated using an integrator circuit in
  combination with a comparator. Triangle waves are useful in various
  applications, including audio synthesis, modulation techniques, and as a
  reference signal in analog systems. The frequency and amplitude can be
  adjusted through the selection of resistors and capacitors, ensuring
  adaptability to specific requirements.
